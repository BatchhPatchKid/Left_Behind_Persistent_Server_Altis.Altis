    --------------------
    This script checks if the player has any uncooked meat from _meatPairs;
    if so, it removes ONE uncooked piece and adds the corresponding cooked version,
    displaying a hint about what was converted.
    
    Usage:
        [player] call FN_cookOnePiece;  // or however you're calling it in your mission
*/
