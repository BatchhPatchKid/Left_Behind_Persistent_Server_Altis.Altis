To do:
- lower difficutly?
- more missions at the traders
	1) Destroy a designated vehicle
	
- Develop my own looting system
- random location spawned multiple factions on each other
- mutant effects wear off after leaving the trigger
- trader gave an NLAW to Eli after (unable to replicate)
- weapon holstered on back doesn't get deleted
- When gutting, allow for a chance to obtain a bag of 250ml's of blood

Fixes:
- no animations for eating or drinkning? (Fixed hopefully)
- restructure scenario actions (Done)
- cook meat missing hints for no meat found in inventory (FIXED)
- water too prevelant now (Possibly fixed)
- geiger counter telling me I'm being irraditated despite taking no radiation - did eventually stop
- restructure scenario actions (Done)

- random encounter heli flyby did not give hint
- return weapon info: fire rate, ranging
- looting hint still doesn't display to client

Notes:
- Good animation for psionsics injury: _player playMove "AinvPknlMstpSnonWnonDnon_healed_1"; (or _2)

Update:
- 

possible poop animation:
With gun: Acts_AidlPercMstpSloWWrflDnon_warmup_6_loop
Without gun: Acts_AidlPercMstpSnonWnonDnon_warmup_4_loop
