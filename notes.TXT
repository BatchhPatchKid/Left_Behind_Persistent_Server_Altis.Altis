To do:
- lower difficutly?
- more missions at the traders
	1) Destroy a designated vehicle
	
- Develop my own looting system
- random location spawned multiple factions on each other
- mutant effects wear off after leaving the trigger
- trader gave an NLAW to Eli after (unable to replicate)
- weapon holstered on back doesn't get deleted
- When gutting, allow for a chance to obtain a bag of 250ml's of blood

Fixes:
- no animations for eating or drinkning? (Fixed hopefully)
- restructure scenario actions (Done)
- cook meat missing hints for no meat found in inventory (FIXED)
- water too prevelant now (Possibly fixed)
- geiger counter telling me I'm being irraditated despite taking no radiation - did eventually stop
- restructure scenario actions (Done)

- random encounter heli flyby did not give hint
- return weapon info: fire rate, ranging
- looting hint still doesn't display to client (nvm)
- water objects to gain water actions at them using similar system to loot system
- repair vehicle takes longer, but uses ace methods
- have player rituals to gain powers
- spawn location on dedicated server spawned multiple loot spawns: it seems it ignores minimum spawning distance/spawns on other loot piles
- sphere's do not delete - turn back into invisible helipad
- ace interacts not allowing for loot piles
- loot pool for scavenging a littl crazy
- Pig Flesh worship a big pig - represents limbo: Great pig
- Ambient 
- Abaraham the pig tenderozier needs to be mentioned - lives in the military dome in PF territory (he really hates animals)
- Shamans - political structure: Speaker of the Great Pig
- Emissary of the Wanderer
- War criminals - joined Bandits
- BB worship original two leaders
- MAKE water and food meter go down slower
- make water and food more likely to be found while looting
- The betray of one founder to another BB (60 years ago)
- Ritualistic keys for player powers - unlocked 
- Shamans selected from birth, raised into it
- Prophets of the trident - for Deadmans Trident
- Children of the Dark - new name for the Raven's Cloak. They follow/worship the Wanderer
- Faction leaders, rank structure - special clothing for leaders
- percent to die from hunger/hydration down to 2

Notes:
- Good animation for psionsics injury: _player playMove "AinvPknlMstpSnonWnonDnon_healed_1"; (or _2)
- good command for playing radio transmissions: unit globalRadio radioName

Update:
- 

possible poop animation:
With gun: Acts_AidlPercMstpSloWWrflDnon_warmup_6_loop
Without gun: Acts_AidlPercMstpSnonWnonDnon_warmup_4_loop
