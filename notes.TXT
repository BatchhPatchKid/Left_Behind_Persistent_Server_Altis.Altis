To do:
- water objects to gain water actions at them using similar system to loot system
- have player rituals to gain powers
- loot pool for scavenging a littl crazy
- add artifacts to the vendors
- add leave animation action when completing an action (cook meat)
- tasks not assigning in dedicated server
- Faction leaders, rank structure - special clothing for leaders
- Animations local on dedicated server
- wisdom does not activate on AI
- ritual actions sometimes duplicate
- loot system spawns too many helipads in dense cities. Great for high end rigs, but bad for bad rigs.
maybe increase amount of space a loot pile can spawn from each other
- have zombies be forced silent when spawned
- Different praying for different powers
- blinding spell
- animations for spells to be public

Notes:
- Good animation for psionsics injury: _player playMove "AinvPknlMstpSnonWnonDnon_healed_1"; (or _2)
- good command for playing radio transmissions: unit globalRadio radioName
- The betray of one founder to another BB (60 years ago)
- Ritualistic keys for player powers - unlocked 
- Shamans selected from birth, raised into it
- Prophets of the trident - for Deadmans Trident
- Children of the Dark - new name for the Raven's Cloak. They follow/worship the Wanderer
- Pig Flesh worship a big pig - represents limbo: Great pig
- Abaraham the pig tenderozier needs to be mentioned - lives in the military dome in PF territory (he really hates animals)
- Shamans - political structure: Speaker of the Great Pig
- Emissary of the Wanderer
- War criminals - joined Bandits
- BB worship original two leaders
