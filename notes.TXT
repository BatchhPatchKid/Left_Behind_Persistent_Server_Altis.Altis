To do:
- lower difficutly?
- more missions at the traders
	1) Destroy a designated vehicle
	
- Develop my own looting system
- random location spawned multiple factions on each other
- mutant effects wear off after leaving the trigger
- trader gave an NLAW to Eli after (unable to replicate)
- weapon holstered on back doesn't get deleted
- possibly invisible melee AI
- When gutting, allow for a chance to obtain a bag of 250ml's of blood
- Talk about which meat's are which in the Survival System diary record
- less AI in patrol area's? (2 primary amount in patrol groups)

Notes:
- Good animation for psionsics injury: _player playMove "AinvPknlMstpSnonWnonDnon_healed_1"; (or _2)

Update:
- 

possible poop animation:
With gun: Acts_AidlPercMstpSloWWrflDnon_warmup_6_loop
Without gun: Acts_AidlPercMstpSnonWnonDnon_warmup_4_loop


_handle = 0 spawn {
	player playMove "AmovPercMstpSrasWrflDnon_AmovPknlMstpSlowWrflDnon";
	sleep 1.5;
	player switchMove "Acts_AidlPercMstpSloWWrflDnon_warmup_6_loop"; 
	sleep 20;
	player playMoveNow "AmovPercMstpSrasWrflDnon"; 
};
