To do:
- lower difficutly?
- more missions at the traders
	1) Destroy a designated vehicle
	
- Develop my own looting system
- random location spawned multiple factions on each other
- mutant effects wear off after leaving the trigger
- trader gave an NLAW to Eli after (unable to replicate)
- weapon holstered on back doesn't get deleted
- When gutting, allow for a chance to obtain a bag of 250ml's of blood
- if inventory is full, the skinned animal meat should be dropped on the ground
- WATER PURIFICATION TABLET: lower $3
- water and food items should refill the hunger and thirst bars more (priority)
- water and food items should be more common (priority)
- maps, compasses, watches, and radio should be more common (priority)
- loot system needs to be created
- garbage collection not working on dedicated server?

Notes:
- Good animation for psionsics injury: _player playMove "AinvPknlMstpSnonWnonDnon_healed_1"; (or _2)

Update:
- 

possible poop animation:
With gun: Acts_AidlPercMstpSloWWrflDnon_warmup_6_loop
Without gun: Acts_AidlPercMstpSnonWnonDnon_warmup_4_loop


_handle = 0 spawn {
	player playMove "AmovPercMstpSrasWrflDnon_AmovPknlMstpSlowWrflDnon";
	sleep 1.5;
	player switchMove "Acts_AidlPercMstpSloWWrflDnon_warmup_6_loop"; 
	sleep 20;
	player playMoveNow "AmovPercMstpSrasWrflDnon"; 
};
